# Data Science Portfolio - Charithesh Reddy

I am interested in new data science opportunities, please contact me on my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/charithesh-reddy/">Linkedin page</a> for business purpose.

This consists of all the projects I have worked on that helped me to improve my Data Science skills. The projects contain all/some of the Data Science related skills like cleaning data, analysing and visulization of insights, and applying machine learning algorithms to predict the future trends. The projects are completed using R or Python with Jupyter notebooks. A brief description os provide for each project and to for more details please click on the links of the respective projects.
