# Data Science Portfolio - Charithesh Reddygari

I am passionate about data science and interested in new opportunities, please contact me on my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/charithesh-reddy/">Linkedin</a> for business purpose.

The portfolio consists of all projects I have worked to improve my Data Science skills. The projects contain many of the Data Science related skills like cleaning data, analyzing and visualizing for insights, and applying machine learning algorithms to predict the future trends. The projects are completed using (R or Python) Jupyter notebooks. A brief description is provided for each project and for more details, please click on the links of the respective projects.


 <h3><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/charitheshreddy/titanic-survival-prediction?scriptVersionId=19703490"> Predicting the survival of the passenger in the titanic disaster using stacking</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Data cleaning and analysis using pandas, seaborn and matplotlib</li>
  <li>Transformed the categorial features into reasonable numeric features</li>
  <li>Compared multiple classifiers to fit the model</li>
  <li>Final predictions were made using the Random forest classifier</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3><a href="https://github.com/charithesh/Caravan-Insurance-Customers/blob/master/Caravan%20Insurance%20Customers.ipynb"> Choosing and explaining likely caravan insurance customers</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>EDA is performed on the given data using ggplot2 and other statistics in R</li>
  <li>Unlikely and likely related features are obtained</li>
  <li>Predictive modelling is developed for the caravan insurance customer</li>
