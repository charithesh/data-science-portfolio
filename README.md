# Data Science Portfolio - Charithesh Reddy

I am passionate about data science and interested in new opportunities, please contact me on my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/charithesh-reddy/">Linkedin page</a> for business purpose.

This consists of all the projects I have worked on that helped me to improve my Data Science skills. The projects contain all/some of the Data Science related skills like cleaning data, analysing and visulization of insights, and applying machine learning algorithms to predict the future trends. The projects are completed using R or Python with Jupyter notebooks. A brief description os provide for each project and to for more details please click on the links of the respective projects.


<h3><a href="https://github.com/charithesh/Caravan-Insurance-Customers/blob/master/Caravan%20Insurance%20Customers.ipynb"> Choosing and Explaining Likely Caravan Insurance Customers</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>EDA is perfromed on the given data usin ggplot2 and other statistics in R</li>
  <li>Unlikely and likely related features are obtaied</li>
  <li>Predictive modelling is done to predict the caravan insurance customer prediction</li>
 </ul>
 

 <h3><a href=" https://www.kaggle.com/charitheshreddy/titanic-survival-prediction/data?scriptVersionId=19563159"> Predicitng the survival of the passanger in the titanic disasster</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>EDA is perfromed on the given data usin seaborn and matplotlib</li>
  <li>Tranformed the categorial features into reasonable numeric features</li>
  <li>Compared multiple classifiers to fit the model</li>
  <li>Final predictions were made using the Random forest classifier</li>
 </ul>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/charithesh/Boston-crimes-EDA/blob/master/Boston%20crimes.ipynb"> EDA on Boston crimes </a></h3> 
<ul>
  <li> Downloaded the data from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston">Kaggle</a> and cleaned the data </li>
  <li>Among the multiple crime available, only serious crime are considered for the analysis</li>
  <li>Few of the analysis performed are when, where and how frequent do they occur </li>
 </ul>
